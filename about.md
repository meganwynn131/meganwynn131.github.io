**_Over  here, we do imperfect, we do real_**

If I had to sum up my beliefs in a few words, I'd say that I believe in living simply, loving what you have, and focusing on doing what really makes you happy

I show a little pieces of my life,  jewelry-making, meal-prepping, a minimalist approach, budgeting, and my favorite things. I hope you'll stick around and maybe learn a thing or two while you're here!
